# Problem 1
# Input: Integer n
# Output: Prints n number of fibonacci numbers starting from 0

def fibonacci(n):
    # write code here



# Problem 2
# Input: Integer n
# Output: The sum of all integers less then n that are divisible by 3 and 5

def threeFiveSum(n):
    # write code here

print threeFiveSum(1000)



# Problem 3
# Input: a list of integers
# Output: the sum of all even integers in the list

def sumOfAllEvens():
    # write all code here

print(sumOfAllEvens([2, 43, 523, 232, 24]))



# Problem 4
# Code a game of rock, paper, scissors

def playRockPaperScissors():
    # write code here

# Problem 5
# Input: Integer n
# Output: n factorial (n!)
# Bonus: Use recursion in your function

def factorial(n):
    # write code here

# Problem 6
# Input: String
# Output: The reverse of the string
# Example: reverse("potato") would return the string "otatop"
# Bonus: Use recursion in your function

def reverseString(s):
    # write code here

print(reverseString("tomato"))

# Problem 7
# Input: 2 strings
# Output: the number of the positions where the two strings contain the same length 2 substring.
# So "xxcaazz" and "xxbaaz" yields 3, since the "xx", "aa", and "az" substrings appear in the same place in both strings.

def def stringMatch(a, b):
    # write code
